# RCFixed
Fixed RCFinal mod for AoTTG

## Changes:
### Custom Name & Guild auto-filling on launch.
If you have saved Name or Guild it will be filled on launch so you do not need to press Load button anymore. Custom Name tab is also showed first instead of Login tab.

### Offline mode.
Press OFFLINE button on Multiplayer Region Choose panel.

### Fixed rebind Dash animation.
Now it equals to double tap Dash animation.

### Fixed Blade Trails appearance.
It is not glitchy anymore.

### Added Restart hotkey
Press [G] to restart the game. If you are in MP it also resets all stats for everyone.

### Added Screenshot hotkey
Press [F5] to capture a screenshot. Screenshots folder is /DATA/Screenshots.

### Fixed messages appearance
Added space after ":" which looks better.
